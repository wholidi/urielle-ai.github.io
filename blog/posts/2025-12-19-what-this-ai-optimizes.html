        <h2>What This AI Optimizes — and Why That Matters</h2>
        <p>Week 1 • Mental Models of Harm (Harris lens)</p>
      </div>

      <article class="card">
        <p>
        Most discussions about AI risk begin with <em>what a system does</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        But that question is incomplete.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A more important — and often overlooked — question is:
        <strong>what does the system optimize for?</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Because once an AI system is deployed at scale, it does more than perform tasks.
        It shapes human behavior, institutional decisions, and social norms — often in ways that were never explicitly intended.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Optimization Is Not Neutral</h3>
        
        <p>
        AI systems do not pursue human values directly.
        They pursue <strong>proxy goals</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        These proxies are usually chosen because they are measurable and operational:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>engagement</li>
          <li>accuracy</li>
          <li>completion rate</li>
          <li>efficiency</li>
          <li>cost reduction</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        On their own, none of these are inherently harmful.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The risk emerges when proxy goals are optimized relentlessly, at scale, without sufficient governance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Consider a recommender system or generative AI assistant designed to maximize engagement.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        At first, engagement feels aligned with usefulness.
        If users stay longer, the system must be helping — right?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        But optimization compounds.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As engagement becomes the dominant success metric:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>content that holds attention is favored over content that improves understanding</li>
          <li>speed and convenience are prioritized over reflection and judgment</li>
          <li>subtle behavioral shifts accumulate, unnoticed in the short term</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        No single decision appears problematic.
        No individual actor intends harm.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This is not individual failure.
        <strong>It is systemic failure.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Wisdom Gap in AI Governance</h3>
        
        <p>
        This dynamic reflects what technology ethicists often describe as a <strong>wisdom gap</strong>:
        our technological power advances faster than our ability to govern its consequences.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        AI systems are exceptionally good at optimizing what we can measure.
        They are far less capable of respecting what we care about but cannot easily quantify.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As systems scale:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>benefits tend to concentrate (efficiency, profit, velocity)</li>
          <li>downsides tend to diffuse (attention erosion, automation bias, distorted incentives)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Diffuse harm is difficult to see, difficult to attribute, and easy to ignore — until it becomes structural.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        By the time governance reacts, the system is often already embedded in workflows, decision-making, and culture.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why Incentives Matter More Than Intent</h3>
        
        <p>
        In many AI risk discussions, intent receives disproportionate attention.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        But AI systems do not require malicious intent to cause harm.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        They require only:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>the wrong objective</li>
          <li>applied consistently</li>
          <li>at sufficient scale</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        This is why effective AI governance cannot begin with compliance checklists alone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        It must begin upstream, with incentive analysis:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>What behavior does this system reward?</li>
          <li>Who benefits as it scales?</li>
          <li>Who bears the downside — gradually, indirectly, and often invisibly?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        If these questions are not asked early, governance efforts end up treating symptoms rather than causes.
        </p>
        
        <h3>From Metrics to Responsibility</h3>
        
        <p>
        Responsible AI design is not about rejecting optimization.
        Optimization is unavoidable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The challenge is ensuring that what we optimize for remains aligned with human judgment,
        institutional accountability, and long-term societal impact.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This is a governance problem as much as a technical one.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        And it is why meaningful AI assurance starts not with models, but with <strong>incentives</strong>.
